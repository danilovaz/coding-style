# coding-style

This is my coding style. And I always use this style in my personal projects.

I'm inspired to create this after see [coding style repository](https://github.com/LFeh/coding-style) by [@LFeh](https://github.com/LFeh/). My coding style is based on [this guide frontend](https://github.com/focusnetworks/guide-frontend) by [@focusnetworks](https://github.com/focusnetworks)

## Quotes

>All code in any code-base should look like a single person typed it, no matter how many people contributed.
><small>– _Rick Waldon_</small>

>Arguments over style are pointless. There should be a style guide, and you should follow it.
><small>– _Rebecca Murphey_</small>

>It’s harder to read code than to write it.
><small>– _Joel Spolsky_</small>

>Part of being a good steward to a successful project is realizing that writing code for yourself is a Bad Idea™. If thousands of people are using your code, then write your code for maximum clarity, not your personal preference of how to get clever within the spec.
><small>– _Idan Gazit_</small>
